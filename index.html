  <h2>Common Problems</h2>
  <p align="left">
    <i>Problem:</i> I hear ringing in the background while I'm on a call. How can I make it stop?<br>
    <i>Solution:</i> This probably means you have Talkdesk open in a browser tab. To make the ringing stop, you can mute the tab(s) which have Talkdesk open by right-clicking the top of the tab and selecting "Mute Tab"
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    <i>Problem:</i> VroomCast isn't telling me whether the caller is expecting Vroom or TDA when I answer the phone.<br>
    <i>Solution:</i> VroomCast will not always be able to tell you what the customer is expecting if they call you directly. We can only inform you which brand to say if the person is calling a number on one of our ads that is associated with one of our brands (e.g. Vroom-Craisglist-Chicago).
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    <i>Problem:</i> My headset doesn't appear to be working or my customers cannot hear me.<br>
    <i>Solution:</i> Please ensure your headset's USB cable is plugged in and the headset is configured with Windows as the default audio source. If you need help, please send an email describing the problem to helpdesk@texasdirectauto.com
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    <i>Problem:</i> When clicking the button to transfer a call, I get an error that says "transfer failed".<br>
    <i>Solution:</i> We are aware of this issue; until it is sorted out, you can manually type in the phone number you wish to transfer the call to.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    <i>Problem:</i> I can't log in to VroomCast or VroomCast isn't working properly.<br>
